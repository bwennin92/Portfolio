          <p>Hi! My name is Brandon and I like to code. I started to code in March and fell in love with it.</p>
          <br />
          <p>It has been what seems like a long journey when I began my course with General Assembly and I have learned so much. From learning Javascript, React, Node.js,Python, MongoDB, SQL and Django.</p>
          <p>Come follow me on my journey to being a software developer!</p>
